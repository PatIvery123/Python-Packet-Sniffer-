# Python Packet Sniffer

## Objective

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with network protocols and packet analysis.
- Apply cybersecurity concepts such as traffic monitoring and threat detection.
- Utilize Python and Scapy for network security tasks.
- Strengthen my skills in network forensics and cybersecurity analysis.







### Tools Used

- **Python**: Used as the primary programming language for developing the packet sniffer tool, leveraging its simplicity and power for network analysis tasks.
- **Scapy**: The main library for packet sniffing, crafting, and analysis. It enabled the capture and manipulation of network packets in real-time.


## Steps
1. **Install Dependencies**: Install **Python** and the **Scapy** library using `pip install scapy`.
2. **Set Up Network Interface**: Identify and configure the network interface to capture packets (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
3. **Start Sniffing**: Use Scapyâ€™s `sniff()` function to capture packets from the network.
4. **Filter Packets**: Apply filters to capture specific packets based on protocol, IP address, or port number.
5. **Analyze Packets**: Extract relevant data (e.g., IPs, ports) and analyze the captured packets for insights.
